Welcome to MoSwA Documentation!
===================================

**Motif SWitch Analyser** is a tool that not only identifies all alignment k-mer positions that exhibit 
motif switching, but also provides a multi-faceted and extensive characterisation of the switches.

You can simply upload your aligned file to `MoSwA Web <http://moswa.bioinfo.perdanauniversity.edu.my//>`_
which offers a *simple* and *intuitive* usage.
.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to stand alone :ref:`installation` of MoSwA.
